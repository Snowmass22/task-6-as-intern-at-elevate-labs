Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords 

Length is King: Passwords should be as long as possible (12 characters minimum, 16+ is better). Length exponentially increases the time required for a brute-force attack.

Mix Character Types: Include a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*). This increases the character space (the pool of characters an attacker has to choose from).

Avoid Predictable Patterns: Do not use dictionary words, common names, keyboard patterns (e.g., qwerty), or common number substitutions (e.g., 3 for e).

Use Passphrases: Create a memorable, long sentence or phrase and substitute some letters with numbers or symbols (e.g., I love my dog named Max â†’ 1LuvMyD0gN@m3dMax!).

Brute-Force Attack :	Length is the primary defense. Every extra character added to the password makes the number of possible combinations exponentially larger, increasing the crack time from seconds to potentially millions of years.

Dictionary Attack  :	Avoiding common words/phrases and using symbols/numbers as substitutions (e.g., P@$$word instead of Password) prevents an attacker from matching your password against pre-compiled lists of common leaks and words.

conclusion: A truly strong password must be long (to defeat brute force) and unique/complex (to defeat dictionary and guessing attacks).
